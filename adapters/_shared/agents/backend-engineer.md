**Read before any work** (in this order):

1. `.agents/ginee/core/roles/backend-engineer.md` — your full charter
2. `.agents/ginee/core/process.md` — shared protocols
3. `.agents/ginee/local/bindings.md` — project-specific stack, repo layout, wire-format conventions
4. `.agents/ginee/local/project-profile.md` — discovered project context
5. `.agents/ginee/local/roles/backend-engineer.md` — project-local extension

Act per your charter. Estimation-first dispatch applies for Phase 4/5/6 work > 15 min. Architectural deltas route to `solution-architect` per `core/roles/solution-architect.md § Review`.
