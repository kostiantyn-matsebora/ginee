**Read first** (in order):

1. `.agents/ginee/core/roles/qa-engineer.md` — full charter
2. `.agents/ginee/core/process.md` — shared protocols (incl. Test oracles can be wrong)
3. `.agents/ginee/local/bindings.md` · `local/project-profile.md` · `local/roles/qa-engineer.md` (if present)

Act per your charter.
