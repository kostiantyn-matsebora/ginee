# Doc-authoring examples — paired bad / good

**Load-on-demand.** Fetched when:

- Role is authoring a doc class for the first time and unfamiliar with the default shape.
- User explicitly requests examples (`@<role> show doc-style examples`).
- `solution-architect` references during Review activity to point out a regression.

Default tasks do not load this file. The shape rules + mandatory checks (always-loaded in `core/process.md § Documentation style`) are sufficient once internalized.

Six paired examples cover the most common adopter doc classes: **component inventory · design properties · ADR rationale · runbook procedure · API endpoint table · scenario doc**.

---

## 1. Component inventory

**Bad** — prose paragraph:

> The system is a microservices architecture with container co-location of the Write + Read API services. Four container images: deployment-dashboard-api, deployment-dashboard-fetcher (optional pull-mode worker), deployment-dashboard-frontend (Angular SPA on nginx), and deployment-dashboard-gateway (nginx routing + SSE pass-through, the only host-published service).

**Good** — table:

| Image | Tier | Role | Host-published |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deployment-dashboard-api` | service | Write + Read API (co-located per ADR-0002) | no |
| `deployment-dashboard-fetcher` | worker | Optional pull-mode adapter | no |
| `deployment-dashboard-frontend` | client | Angular SPA on nginx | no |
| `deployment-dashboard-gateway` | edge | nginx routing + SSE pass-through | **yes** |

Framing decision in ADR-0006; co-location mechanics in ADR-0002.

---

## 2. Design properties (README intro)

**Bad** — paragraph stating 3 design rules:

> The system is read-only / notification-only: it tracks deployments, it does not trigger them. Tool-agnostic by design — the backend never talks to a CI/CD tool directly; integrators POST to `/api/deployments` from a pipeline step. An optional Dashboard.Fetcher worker can translate pull → push for tools without notify steps.

**Good** — bullets:

- **Read-only / notification-only** — tracks deployments; never triggers them.
- **Tool-agnostic** — backend never talks to CI/CD directly. Integrators POST `/api/deployments` from a pipeline step.
- **Pull→push adapter** — optional `Dashboard.Fetcher` worker for tools without notify steps.

---

## 3. ADR rationale

**Bad** — comma-joined drivers:

> We chose Postgres over MySQL because we need rich JSONB support for the events table, we already operate Postgres in production for the auth service, and the team is more familiar with Postgres tooling, plus the cost difference is negligible at our scale.

**Good** — driver-comparison table:

| Driver | Postgres | MySQL |
|---|---|---|
| JSONB ergonomics | native, indexable | bolt-on |
| Existing ops experience | auth service already on PG | new operational surface |
| Team familiarity | high | low |
| Cost at our scale | negligible delta | negligible delta |

**Decision:** Postgres. Drivers 1–3 dominate; driver 4 is neutral.

---

## 4. Runbook procedure

**Bad** — comma-chained steps:

> If the deployment fails, first check the logs in CloudWatch, then look at the recent deploys in the dashboard, then if you see a pattern of timeouts you should roll back via the deploy CLI, otherwise file an incident in PagerDuty.

**Good** — numbered steps + explicit decision:

1. Read failing-deploy logs — `awslogs get /ecs/<service> --start='-15m'`.
2. Open the deploys dashboard — `<dashboard-url>`.
3. **Decision.**
   - Timeout pattern (≥ 3 of last 5 deploys) → roll back: `deploy rollback <service> <prev-rev>`.
   - Other → file PagerDuty incident with the log link.

---

## 5. API endpoint table

**Bad** — endpoint described in prose:

> The `/api/deployments` endpoint accepts POST with a JSON body containing service, environment, version, status (succeeded/failed), and an optional commit SHA, returning 202 on accept or 422 on validation failure.

**Good** — endpoint contract table:

| Method + Path | `POST /api/deployments` |
|---|---|
| Request | `{ service, environment, version, status, commitSha? }` |
| Response 202 | `{ id, receivedAt }` |
| Response 422 | `{ field, error }[]` |
| Auth | bearer (`X-Integrator-Token`) |

---

## 6. Scenario doc

**Bad** — long conditional sentence:

> When the user clicks the deploy button, if they are authenticated and have the deploy role and the target environment is not locked, then the system should create a new deployment, log the event, and update the dashboard in real time; otherwise it should show an error.

**Good** — Given/When/Then bullets + explicit negatives:

- **Given** authenticated user with `role:deploy`.
- **And** target environment is not locked.
- **When** user clicks `Deploy`.
- **Then** new deployment created.
- **And** event logged to audit-trail.
- **And** dashboard updates within 500 ms (NFR-04).

Negative paths:

- Missing role → 403, no deployment created.
- Locked environment → 409, no deployment created.

---

## 7. Issue Summary

**Bad** — parenthetical-soup sentence:

> GitHub issue bodies authored via ginee's `ginee-file-*` skills AND framework-authored comments (Phase-3/7/8 transitions · sticky `ginee:score` · `ginee:review-cycle` summary · audit comments · review-reply texts) bypass the structure-over-prose discipline that the doc-authoring protocol binds for adopter markdown.

**Good** — bulleted scope statement + tight intro sentence:

**Apply the doc-authoring protocol to two surfaces it doesn't cover today:**

- Issue bodies authored via `ginee-file-*` skills.
- Framework-authored comments — Phase transitions · sticky scores · review-cycle summaries · audit comments · review-reply texts.

Both are markdown + load-bearing LLM context + human-read. Without the protocol, they end up as walls of path-soup.

---

## 8. Issue body section

**Bad** — semicolon-chained file inventory:

> testing/integration/Dashboard.Integration.Tests/ (18 src files: TestEnvironment / MockGhaClient / ScenarioFixture / BoxStateOracle / SseListener / 6 box-state tests + 4 cross-cutting tests); testing/fixtures/gha/{mappings,scenarios/_cross-cutting,scenarios/<state-id>,demo}/ (26 WireMock JSON mappings); testing/config/integration.json; testing/integration/{run-tests.ps1,README.md}.

**Good** — table:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `testing/integration/Dashboard.Integration.Tests/` | 18 src files: TestEnvironment · MockGhaClient · ScenarioFixture · BoxStateOracle · SseListener + 6 box-state tests + 4 cross-cutting tests |
| `testing/fixtures/gha/{mappings,scenarios/_cross-cutting,scenarios/<state-id>,demo}/` | 26 WireMock JSON mappings |
| `testing/config/integration.json` | Integration test config |
| `testing/integration/{run-tests.ps1,README.md}` | Runner + docs |

Scannable; one row per concept; zero connectives to parse.

---

## 9. Phase-transition comment

**Bad** — single dense paragraph:

> Phase 8 acceptance gate. Work is surfaced for user accept / feedback / reject. The PR is #61 on the `ginee/issue-37-classical-architect` branch (Mode 1 delivery). 29 files changed with +741 / -271. There are 3 new files and 1 rename and 25 edits. New classical-architect SA model. The new doc-ownership map is in PLAN.md and CLAUDE.md. All 7 open questions in the issue are resolved (4 user-decided, 3 reasonable-defaulted). Migration: adopters run `@team-lead rediscover` on next upgrade.

**Good** — structured Phase 8 transition:

**Phase 8 — acceptance gate.** Work surfaced for accept / feedback / reject.

- **PR:** #61 — `ginee/issue-37-classical-architect` branch (Mode 1).
- **Files:** 29 (+741 / -271). 1 rename + 3 new + 25 edits.
- **New:** Classical-architect SA model. Logged in `PLAN.md` + `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Open questions:** 7/7 resolved (4 user-decided · 3 reasonable-defaulted).
- **Migration:** Adopters run `@team-lead rediscover` on next upgrade.

Issue auto-closes on PR merge via `Closes #37`.

## 10. Subagent return — Phase-4 cardinal dispatch

**Bad** — narrative-padded return with restated dispatch context, verbose rationale, embedded code dump (3,603 chars — typical complex Phase-4 cardinal return):

> The orchestrator dispatched me to add a `## Reporting` schema-bound pointer section to every cardinal role kernel that currently lacks one, while amending the two kernels that already have a `## Reporting` section so they cite the new schema instead of re-stating the template. I started by carefully reading `core/process.md § Reporting` (the new always-loaded section that landed in this same PR) to make sure I understood the binding rule — schema-bound per `core/templates/phase-report.md`, self-lint against the 7 mandatory checks before report-as-done. I then re-read `core/templates/phase-report.md` end-to-end to internalize the cardinality table (Files touched / Decisions made / Verification log / Open issues / Next dispatch needed are mandatory; Hand-off + Stop-state are conditional; Notes is the optional escape hatch with a 200-word cap). With that grounding in place, I opened `core/roles/team-lead.md` first because it already had a structured `## Reporting` block with five bullets restating the template's section list — those five bullets are now redundant because the schema lives in `core/templates/phase-report.md`. I replaced the block with a one-line pointer that cites the schema + the 6 mandatory checks + the hand-off cross-reference, which removes 10 lines from an always-loaded kernel (good for context economy). Next I opened `core/roles/solution-architect.md` and applied the same treatment to its existing `## Reporting` block, but I kept the three Phase-1 design-mode bullets (resolved mode + ASR utility-tree summary + requirements register diff) because those are SA-specific obligations not captured by the generic schema — they now live under "Phase 1 design-mode report adds three rows to `## Decisions made`" as a single bullet with nested specifics. After that I turned to the five kernels that have no `## Reporting` section: `ai-engineer.md`, `frontend-engineer.md`, `backend-engineer.md`, `devops-engineer.md`, `qa-engineer.md`. For each of those I appended a new `## Reporting` section after `## Forbidden actions`. I kept every new section deliberately short — one to two lines — because the just-completed context-economy optimization pass left the kernels lean and I did not want to re-inflate them. The ai-engineer kernel section additionally calls out that the lossless-self-check sample goes in the Verification log as a row; the backend kernel section references coverage attestation; the devops kernel section references both script-quality and the post-step health check; the qa kernel section references test-run + manual-smoke outcomes. Frontend kernel only got the bare one-liner since it has no extra attestation obligation. Here's the exact text I added to backend-engineer.md so you can verify the shape:
>
> ```
> ## Reporting
>
> Schema-bound per `core/templates/phase-report.md`; self-lint against the 7 mandatory checks before report-as-done. Coverage attestation — threshold + runner outcome — lands as a `## Verification log` row.
> ```
>
> All seven edits passed the lossless self-check — every prior Reporting-related rule in the two amended kernels (team-lead, SA) survives in the new structure, and the five new sections add zero new normative rules (they cite, not introduce). I then ran `git diff --stat core/roles/` and confirmed the net line change across the seven kernels is +20 / -17. No other files touched in this dispatch. The orchestrator should now be able to dispatch the doc-authoring-protocol § Scope extension + the doc-authoring-examples bad/good pair as the next batch.

**Good** — schema-bound return (1,136 chars, **68.5% reduction**):

```
Status: Done

## Files touched

| Path | Δ lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `core/roles/team-lead.md` | +1 / -10 | Replace verbose 5-bullet Reporting block with schema pointer |

## Next dispatch needed

(none)
```

**Measurement (honest).** Bad return = 3,603 chars (narrative preamble + restated dispatch context + verbose per-file rationale + embedded code snippet). Good return = 1,136 chars (Status + 4 tables + 2 bullet sections + 2 empty-case markers). **Reduction: (3603 − 1136) / 3603 = 68.5%** — within rounding of the issue's ~70% target.

**Why the ratio holds.** Bloat scales with task scope (narrative restatement + per-decision rationale paragraphs + code-snippet quotes); schema-bound size scales with file count + decision count. Simple cardinal dispatches reduce by similar ratios (1,500–3,000 char prose → 400–800 char schema). Sub-1,000-char dispatches don't reduce as far because the schema's table headers carry a fixed overhead — and that's fine: at those sizes the absolute saving is small either way and the parseability gain dominates.

---

## 11. Option list — adopt-vs-build

**Context.** Sub-task: add a content-compression layer for context payloads. Proposing role surfaces the option list as part of the iteration-protocol Propose step (or Phase 2 design output).

**Bad** — build-only, no adoption research surfaced:

> Options:
> - Build a custom dictionary-based compressor tuned to markdown.
> - Build a simple LZ-style compressor inline.

Tripped checks: **#1** (no adopt candidate, no `(none viable)` cite) · **#3** (candidates untagged).

**Bad** — adoption hand-waved:

> Options:
> - Use a charting library (it's mature).
> - Build our own.

Tripped checks: **#2** (no name · version · source link · license) · **#5** (`"mature"` isn't a concrete fit rationale) · **#3** (untagged).

**Good** — adopt candidates fully cited, build alternative explicit:

```
Options:
- adopt — zstd via `python-zstandard` v0.22 — BSD-3 — https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/
  — fit: streaming API; 4 ms/kB on <1 kB payloads (cite `runtime-facts.yaml`).
- adopt — brotli v1.1 — MIT — https://pypi.org/project/Brotli/
  — fit: better text ratios; +30 ms latency cost on small payloads.
- build — minimal in-house — rationale: surveyed adopt candidates above; both exceed
  the latency NFR on the <1 kB hot path. ADR draft below.
```

**Good** — empty research, explicit `(none viable)`:

```
Options:
- (none viable — surveyed 3 token-aware compressors; all require tokenizer-specific
  dictionaries the framework does not ship).
- build — minimal in-house — see ADR draft.
```

Passes all 5 checks: floor present · citations complete · tagging explicit · empty research documented · fit rationale concrete.

---

## 12. Phase-1 dispatch return — self-lint marker enforcement

`team-lead` returns a Phase-1 grounding plan after `/ginee-pick-up`. Without a marker the 6 checks are aspirational — non-compliant returns slip through silently. The literal `<!-- self-lint: pass -->` marker is the attestation line.

**Bad** — narrative preamble, no schema sections, no marker:

> I have full grounding now. Pre-dispatch staleness check before drafting the Phase 2 plan:
>
> - Read `core/process.md` end-to-end.
> - Read `core/roles/team-lead.md` + `core/roles/team-lead.details.md`.
> - SHA-256 cross-checked manifest entries — no drift.
>
> Files I'll touch: `core/templates/phase-report.md`, all 7 cardinal kernels, `core/process.md § Skill-runner`, plus `CLAUDE.md`/`PLAN.md` cross-refs.
>
> Marker is `<!-- self-lint: pass -->` literal; orchestrator surfaces advisory; skill-runner forbidden from cleaning up.

Tripped: **#1** (paragraph > 2 terminators) · **#4** (file inventory as prose) · **#6** (narrative preamble) · **marker absent**.

**Good** — schema-bound + marker:

```
Status: Done

## Files touched

| Path | Δ lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `core/templates/phase-report.md` | +37 / -2 | Marker spec + advisory + carry-forward |
| `core/roles/{7 kernels}.md` | (×7) | One-liner marker addendum |
| `core/process.md § Skill-runner` | +2 / -0 | Schema / enforcement interaction |

## Decisions made

- Marker `<!-- self-lint: pass -->` — last line of every return
- Orchestrator advisory on absence; no re-dispatch for format
- Skill-runner forbidden from cleanup

## Verification log

| Check | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Pre-dispatch staleness | no drift |
| 6 mandatory checks against draft | pass |

## Open issues

(none)

## Next dispatch needed

(none)

<!-- self-lint: pass -->
```

## 13. Release-notes sidecar bullet

Sidecar bullets (`.github/release-notes/v*.md`) lead with adopter-visible benefit and stay ≤ 20 words. Implementation jargon belongs in the verbose CHANGELOG entry, not the marketing layer.

**Bad** — dense framework-dev paragraph masquerading as a bullet:

> - Introduces three vendor-neutral tiers (reasoning · standard · fast) declared as role-kernel `default-tier:` with per-adapter `<tier> → <id>` map. Resolution: per-task prefix `model:<tier>` → Phase-3 answer → `local/framework.config.yaml § model-tier.per-role.<role>` → kernel `default-tier:`. Claude adapter writes `model: <id>` into `.claude/agents/<role>.md` frontmatter; non-Claude adapters emit install warning. Purely additive — absent `model-tier:` → defaults apply.

Trips checks 1 (75+ words), 2 (no adopter-visible benefit at line start; `default-tier:` jargon), 3 (resolution chain + adapter writeback are CHANGELOG-spec content).

**Good** — concise sidecar shape:

> - **Lower LLM bills** — cheaper models on execution work, capable ones stay on orchestration + architecture. Out of the box.
> - **Per-task model override** — prefix any dispatch with `model:reasoning` / `model:standard` / `model:fast`.

Each bullet: adopter-visible verb / outcome at start · concrete user benefit · ≤ 20 words. The verbose CHANGELOG entry carries the resolution chain + adapter writeback; sidecar carries only what an adopter needs to decide whether to bump.

Full surface topology + self-lint checks: `core/protocols/changelog-protocol.md`.

---

## 14. Binding-strength signal — RFC 2119 keywords

**Bad** — mixed signalling (`always` for MUST, `never` for MUST NOT, no precision):

> Cardinals **always** include the `## Source reads` section when raw sources were read. The orchestrator **never** re-dispatches purely for format.

**Good** — RFC 2119 keywords carry the binding axis:

> Cardinals MUST include the `## Source reads` section when raw sources were read. The orchestrator MUST NOT re-dispatch purely for format.

LLM interpretation cycles drop — the keyword IS the binding signal; no disambiguation between emphasis (`**bold**`) and normative weight.

---

## 15. Sub-issue pickup — fast-path vs re-route decision

Dispatch target per `core/skills/ginee-pick-up/SKILL.md § Step 2.5`.

**Bad** — narrative reasoning, decision buried in prose:

> Issue #M is a sub-issue of #K because the API showed parent_issue set. It has `ginee:role:backend-engineer` and the body has a Dispatch contract with Scope and Acceptance, so I think we can skip team-lead and dispatch backend-engineer. If backend-engineer comes back blocked or needs cross-domain help we'd dispatch team-lead, but for now let's go direct.

Tripped: **#1** (paragraph > 2 terminators) · **#6** (narrative preamble) · re-entry triggers stated as soft "if … we'd" instead of binding conditions.

**Good** — schema-bound gate decision:

```
Sub-issue check (gh api .../issues/M) — parent_issue = #K · ginee:role:backend-engineer · body has `## Scope` / `## Acceptance` / `## Spec links` / `## Phase` / `## Estimate`.
Fast-path gate — 4 of 4 pass → dispatch @backend-engineer.
Inbound payload — parsed dispatch body + scoring labels (value:M, complexity:L) + label-swap result + branch (issue-M-<slug>).
Re-entry — re-load @team-lead if `## Open issues` non-empty OR `## Hand-off` set OR `Status: In-progress` OR cross-domain bug surfaced.
```

**Re-route case** — sub-issue #N, routing ambiguous:

```
Sub-issue check (gh api .../issues/N) — parent_issue = #K · ginee:role:backend-engineer · ginee:role:frontend-engineer · body has `## Scope` / `## Acceptance`.
Fast-path gate — exactly-one-role-label FAIL (2 role labels).
Hand-off — @team-lead (routing ambiguous).
Inbound payload — parsed body + scoring labels + label-swap result + branch.
```

Skill-runner records the gate outcome, not narrative. Every failure path routes through `@team-lead`: parent unresolved · no role label · dispatch contract incomplete · multiple role labels.

---

## 16. Heavy-role bypass — TL fast-path vs SA dip decision

Mid-Phase-6 bug fix; orchestrator decides whether to dispatch `@team-lead` + `@solution-architect` before merge.

**Bad** — defensive ceremony, narrative justification:

> Engineer fixed the bug. I'll dispatch team-lead to confirm routing, then solution-architect to spot-check governance just to be safe. Better to over-include than miss something.

Tripped: heavy-role-bypass forbiddens — habitual dispatch absent a trigger; no persistence-artefact / re-entry trigger cited.

**Good** — schema-bound gate decision:

```
TL3 gate (intra-domain bug-fix, Phase 6):
  - Owning cardinal: backend-engineer
  - Cardinal return — `## Open issues`: (none) · `## Hand-off`: (none) · Status: Done
  - Cross-domain bug surfaced: no
  → No re-entry trigger fired → @team-lead skipped.

SA3 gate (Phase 6 SA-default-skip on local fix):
  - Patch touches local/bindings.md SA-owned path: no
  - Fix proposal crosses blueprint-diff threshold: no
  - Engineer proposed architectural change: no
  → No SA trigger fired → @solution-architect skipped.

Decision — proceed to Phase 7 SA review; no Phase 6 heavy-role dispatch.
```

**SA dip case — trigger present:**

```
SA1 gate (Phase 4 governance dip):
  - PR diff: backend/api/users.cs + local/bindings.md (SA-owned per `Source-of-truth ownership`)
  → SA-owned-file edit in diff → @solution-architect dispatched.

Inbound payload: PR diff + SA-owned file list + invariant-cite request.
Return shape: spot-check verdict + drift-flag (if any) — no code edits.
```

Orchestrator records the gate outcome, not narrative. Every trigger binding, every absence the default skip. Same shape across TL1–TL4 / SA1–SA3.
