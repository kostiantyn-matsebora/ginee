# Heavy-role bypass

**Load-on-demand.** Fetched by `team-lead` when resolving Phase 4–7 dispatch and the persistence-artefact gate may elide its own or `solution-architect`'s presence. Loaded once per task; cardinals never load it.

## Principle

**Heavy roles are invocation-gated, not phase-gated.** Default is *skip*; dispatch only when the relevant persistence artefact is absent OR a re-entry trigger fires. Presence requires affirmative justification.

**Scope (in).** Phase 4 (Implementation) · 5 (Testing) · 6 (Bug fixing) · 7 (SA review).

**Scope (out — heavy role stays load-bearing).**

| Phase | `team-lead` | `solution-architect` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Analysis | always | always (design dip) |
| 2 — Design | always | always (architecture / ADRs) |
| 3 — Design review | always (synchronous user gate) | n/a |
| 4 / 5 / 6 — Implementation / testing / bug-fix | per persistence-artefact gate | **categorical refusal — never dispatched** (`core/roles/solution-architect.md § Three activities — at a glance`) |
| 7 — Governance review | per TL4 lead-elision | **conditional** — fires only when task introduced architectural changes OR Phase-1 `post-implementation-governance: yes` |
| 8 — User approval | always (delivery finalize) | n/a |

## Persistence-artefact table — bypass valid when artefact present

| Heavy role | Persistence artefact | Bypass valid when ALL hold |
|---|---|---|
| `team-lead` | `ginee:role:*` label + dispatch-contract body (`core/templates/sub-issue-dispatch.md`) | Single role label · dispatch contract present · acceptance criteria unambiguous |

`solution-architect` row REMOVED — SA is no longer invocation-gated for Phase 4/5/6 (categorical refusal). Phase 7 SA dispatch is gated by conditional triggers in `core/roles/team-lead.md § SA dispatch — Phases 4 / 5 / 6 categorically excluded`, not by a persistence-artefact bypass.

Absence of the artefact (or any condition unmet) → `team-lead` dispatched normally.

## Universal re-entry trigger table — heavy role MUST be re-loaded when

| Trigger | Re-loads | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Role label missing or conflicting on sub-issue | `team-lead` | `core/skills/ginee-pick-up/SKILL.md § Step 2.5` |
| Returned `## Open issues` non-empty | `team-lead` | cross-cardinal synthesis needed |
| Returned `## Hand-off` set | `team-lead` | routing change |
| Returned `Status: In-progress` | `team-lead` | stop-state re-decision |
| Cross-domain bug surfaced | `team-lead` | `core/protocols/cross-domain-bugs.md` |
| Multi-cardinal PR (≥ 2 owned-path sets) | `team-lead` | Phase 7 lead-elision — see § Phase 7 |
| Engineer-surfaced architectural-delta (`## Next dispatch needed: team-lead · architectural-delta gate`) | `team-lead` | `core/roles/team-lead.md § Engineer-surfaced architectural-delta gate` |

SA mid-phase re-entry triggers (prior `PR touches SA-owned path` · `NFR-oracle red` · `fix proposal crosses blueprint-diff threshold` · `engineer proposes architectural change mid-phase`) REMOVED — all now route through team-lead's gate, never re-load SA in Phase 4/5/6.

## Per-phase track tables

### Team-lead track

| # | Fast-path | Phase | Default behaviour | First instance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TL1 | Sub-issue pickup | 4 (entry) | Direct cardinal dispatch; `@team-lead` not re-routed | [#152](https://github.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/ginee/issues/152) — `migrations/sub-issue-fast-path.md` |
| TL2 | Single-cardinal verification | 5 | `qa-engineer` runs against AC, returns to owning cardinal; `@team-lead` skipped | This protocol |
| TL3 | Intra-domain bug-fix | 6 | Owning engineer fixes; `@team-lead` re-entered only on cross-domain bug | This protocol |
| TL4 | Phase 7 lead-elision | 7 | Single-cardinal PR → SA → user (when Phase 7 fires); `@team-lead` re-entered only on multi-cardinal PR or REJECT | This protocol |

### SA track — RETIRED

SA1 / SA2 / SA3 (Phase 4 / 5 / 6 SA-default-skip) are RETIRED. SA is no longer dispatched at Phase 4 / 5 / 6 under any condition; default-skip is replaced by categorical refusal. Phase 7 SA dispatch is conditional per `core/roles/team-lead.md § SA dispatch — Phases 4 / 5 / 6 categorically excluded`.

## Phase 7 — lead-elision detail (TL4)

Single-cardinal PR (exactly one owned-path set per `local/bindings.md`) — Phase 7 collapses to `solution-architect` → user. `team-lead` re-enters only when:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Multi-cardinal PR (≥ 2 owned-path sets) | `team-lead` re-enters as gate surface |
| SA returns REJECT or REQUEST-CHANGES | `team-lead` re-enters to dispatch Phase 6 |
| Cross-domain bug surfaced during sign-off | `team-lead` re-enters per `core/protocols/cross-domain-bugs.md` |
| Phase 8 finalize handback in auto mode | `team-lead` re-enters at Phase 8 (separate invariant) |

## Scope-size classification — required even on bypass

Bypass elides team-lead from the dispatch chain; it does NOT elide the scope-size classifier (`core/roles/team-lead.md § Scope-size classifier`). Every TL1–TL4 path records one of `≤15m` · `15-60m` · `>60m` + one-line signal **before bypass approval** — written into the sub-issue body's `**Scope size:**` field per `core/templates/sub-issue-dispatch.md § Body`. Classes `15-60m` / `>60m` load iteration-protocol + require cardinal `## Estimate` return as on the non-bypass path.

| Bypass path | Who classifies | When |
|---|---|---|
| TL1 — sub-issue pickup | skill-runner first-batch (mechanical write of class set at parent dispatch) | At sub-issue create |
| TL2 — single-cardinal verification | Owning cardinal at verification entry | Before QA re-run |
| TL3 — intra-domain bug-fix | Owning engineer | Before fix edit |
| TL4 — Phase 7 lead-elision | SA at review entry | Before APPROVE / REQUEST-CHANGES |

`lite:` prefix auto-classifies as `≤15m`; recorded on the dispatch payload + skipped from iteration-protocol load per `core/process/dispatch.md § Per-task prefix grammar`.

## Forbiddens — bypass does NOT mean orchestration-free

- **Skill-runner.** Never synthesizes returns, reads `local/bindings.md` to settle routing, or proposes defaults. Same boundary as `core/process/dispatch.md § Skill-runner — surface boundary`.
- **Cardinals under bypass.** Author phase-reports per `core/templates/phase-report.md` schema; `## Open issues` / `## Hand-off` / `Status` fields ARE the re-entry signal — never omit when set.
- **Default-skip is the default.** Habitual `@team-lead` / `@solution-architect` dispatch with no trigger is the failure mode. Self-check before each Phase 4–7 heavy-role dispatch: *"Which row of the persistence-artefact table OR re-entry trigger table justifies this load?"* No match → skip.
- **Silent scope-size elision.** Bypass paths MUST emit the one-line classification per § Scope-size classification. `≤15m` written explicitly, never omitted.

## Transcript-grep recipes

| Grep | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@team-lead` invocations in Phase 4–6 windows | Match each against re-entry trigger table. Unmatched → defensive — log advisory. |
| `@solution-architect` dispatches in Phase 4 / 5 / 6 | **Hard violation** — SA categorically refused at those phases. Surface advisory + flag the dispatcher. No legitimate match exists. |
| `@solution-architect` dispatches at Phase 7 | Match against the two conditional triggers in `core/roles/team-lead.md § SA dispatch — Phases 4 / 5 / 6 categorically excluded`. Unmatched → defensive. |
| `## Open issues\n(none)` next to `@team-lead` re-dispatch | Dispatch after a clean return — defensive. |
| `Status: Done` + `## Hand-off` empty + `@team-lead` immediate re-entry | Same — no trigger fired. |

Advisories surface one-line; never auto-rewrite. Aim is to retrain orchestrators, not to gate post-hoc.
