name: Framework feature request (ginee)
about: New capability or improvement to the ginee framework itself
title: "[Framework Feature] <one-line title>"
labels: [ginee:ready, framework]

<!--
  Priority signal (optional but recommended) — add `value:high|medium|low`
  + `complexity:high|medium|low` labels (ATAM utility-tree convention) so
  `ginee-triage` ranks this against other ready framework work.
  Full rules: `.agents/ginee/core/protocols/triage-scoring.md`.

<!--
  Filed against the ginee framework upstream repo (per
  local/framework.config.yaml § github.framework-repo) via:
    @team-lead file framework-feature <title>
  Sections parsed by team-lead when picking up framework work.
  Keep headings intact.

<!--
  Doc shape rules — apply to EVERY section, including Summary:
  - File / endpoint / config inventories → table, not comma-separated prose.
  - Procedures / steps → numbered list.
  - Multi-rule statements → parent bullet + sub-bullets, one rule per line.
  - No paragraph with > 2 sentence terminators.
  - No parenthetical comma-lists inside a sentence — promote to a bulleted list.
  - Cross-reference; never restate (cite `§Name`, `#anchor`).
  Full rules: `core/process.md § Mandatory checks before report-as-done`.
-->

## Summary

<!-- One short bulleted-list or 1–2 short sentences. Avoid parenthetical inventories. -->
<1–2 sentences describing the proposed framework capability>

## Motivation

<what's missing in the current framework — adopter pain, recurring workaround, gap in a locked decision>

## Affected framework surface

<!--
  Where the change would land. Pick one or more:
    process | role-kernel | role-details | new-role | template | adapter | extras-role |
    spec (index-protocol / github-integration / new) | install-mechanism
  Plus the specific file path(s).
-->

- Surface: <categories>
- Files likely touched: `<path-globs>`

## Proposed behavior

<observable framework behavior after the change — what would `team-lead` / cardinals / `ai-engineer` do differently?>

## Owner-decision impact

<!--
  Does this require a new owner decision or amend existing ones?
  Owner's design log lives in PLAN.md (table at § Locked decisions).
  Cite affected decisions by short slug or PLAN.md anchor — these are
  pointers to owner history, NOT load-bearing on the runtime framework.
  Skip the field if the answer is "none".
-->
- New decision needed: `<yes | no>`
- Owner-history pointers: `<short-slug-1 | short-slug-2 | ... | none>`

## Backward compatibility

<!--
  Does this break existing adopters? Required because copy-paste install
  + tarball upgrade are supported — adopters re-fetch core/ on update.
-->
- Breaks existing `local/` files: `<yes | no — explain>`
- Migration note required: `<yes | no>`
