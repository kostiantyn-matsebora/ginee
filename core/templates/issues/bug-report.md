name: Bug report (ginee)
about: Defect that the ginee framework will pick up via @team-lead
title: "[Bug] <one-line title>"
labels: [ginee:ready]
---

<!--
  Priority signal (optional but recommended) — add `value:high|medium|low`
  + `complexity:high|medium|low` labels (ATAM utility-tree convention) so
  `ginee-triage` ranks this against other ready work.
  `value` = user / business impact. `complexity` = implementation cost
  (team-lead will dispatch solution-architect to auto-estimate if missing).
  Full rules: `.agents/ginee/core/protocols/triage-scoring.md`.
-->


<!--
  Sections below are parsed by team-lead on pickup.
  Keep headings (## Summary / ## Steps to reproduce / etc.) intact — do not rename.
  Drop a section only when truly inapplicable; leave the heading + write "(none)".
  Adopters: copy this file to .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ to expose it as a GitHub issue form.
-->

<!--
  Doc shape rules — apply to EVERY section, including Summary:
  - File / endpoint / config inventories → table, not comma-separated prose.
  - Procedures / steps → numbered list.
  - Multi-rule statements → parent bullet + sub-bullets, one rule per line.
  - No paragraph with > 2 sentence terminators.
  - No parenthetical comma-lists inside a sentence — promote to a bulleted list.
  - Cross-reference; never restate (cite `§Name`, `#anchor`).
  Full rules: `core/process.md § Mandatory checks before report-as-done`.
-->
