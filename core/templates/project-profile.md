# Project Profile — `local/project-profile.md` Template

<!-- Per-project. Lives at local/project-profile.md. project-manager writes during discovery; refreshes on rediscover or staleness flag. -->
<!-- Detected snapshot of project shape (stack, domain, architecture artefacts, SDLC artefacts). Complements: -->
<!--   - local/bindings.md — per-project routing + role boundaries (handwritten, seeded by discovery). -->
<!--   - local/framework.config.yaml — concept → file-path mappings (machine-readable). -->
<!-- Read-mostly for roles. project-manager overwrites on rediscover. -->
<!-- Replace bracketed placeholders. Drop sections that yield no content (mark "(none detected)"). -->
