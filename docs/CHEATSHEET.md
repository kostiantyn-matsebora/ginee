# Cheatsheet

One page. Daily use. Bookmark it.

## Install / update

```bash
# Fresh install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/ginee/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --adapter claude
.\install.ps1 -Adapter claude        # PowerShell

# Pin version
./install.sh --ref v0.1.0 --adapter claude
$env:GINEE_REF='v0.1.0'; iwr ... | iex

# Update (preserves local/) — installer is NOT co-located (D27); use /ginee-update or the bootstrap one-liner:
GINEE_UPDATE_ONLY=1 GINEE_ADAPTER=claude bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/ginee/main/install.sh)"
$env:GINEE_UPDATE_ONLY='1'; $env:GINEE_ADAPTER='claude'; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/ginee/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Adapters: `claude` · `copilot-cli` · `agents-md` · `generic`.

## First-day workflow

```
Run initial discovery                  # ginee-discovery skill
```

Then:

```
@<role> <task>                         # dispatch a specialist
auto: <task>                           # elide per-phase gates (D12)
branch: <task>                         # force feature-branch + PR mode (D17)
wt: <task>                             # working-tree only — no commits
commit: <task>                         # commit-no-push
auto: branch: <task>                   # combine — auto mode + branch+PR
```

## Framework skills (tier-1: Claude Code, Copilot CLI)

Slash commands `/ginee-<skill> [args]`. Natural-language phrasings also match. Tier-2/3 fallback: `act as team-lead and …`.

```
/ginee-discovery                          # initial onboarding (Step 2 of install)
/ginee-rediscover                         # full re-discovery + re-extraction
/ginee-file-bug <title>                   # opens issue in primary repo (current)
/ginee-file-feature <title>
/ginee-file-framework-bug <title>         # opens issue in ginee upstream repo
/ginee-file-framework-feature <title>
/ginee-pick-up #<N>                       # GitHub issue (primary repo)
/ginee-pick-up <todo-ref>                 # TODO line (path:line / "TODO about X")
/ginee-pick-up <freeform-description>     # direct instruction
/ginee-triage                             # list ready issues + TODOs
/ginee-triage framework                   # list ready framework upstream issues
/ginee-promote-discussion #<N>            # discussion → draft issue
/ginee-reindex                            # reconcile index with current repo state (whole repo)
/ginee-reindex <file|class>               # scoped reconciliation
/ginee-update                             # update framework to latest release (preserves local/)
/ginee-update <tag|branch|sha>            # update to a named ref
/ginee-address-review #<PR>               # ingest review comments on an open PR (D24)
```

## Freeform requests (any tier)

```
Use ginee to <task description>           # team self-dispatches; no skill needed
```

## Phase lifecycle

| Phase | Goal | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Analysis | Bound scope | ≤ 1 unresolved scope question |
| 2. Design | Lock contracts | Contract surfaces fixed |
| 3. Design review | User approval of Phase 2 | **Explicit user OK** (elided in auto mode if no UX impact) |
| 4. Implementation | Working code | Compiles + unit tests pass |
| 5. Testing | Change-scoped suites + manual smoke | Touched-surface oracles green |
| 6. Bug fixing | Resolve Phase 5 defects | No regressions |
| 7. SA review | Architecture compliance | APPROVE or RETURN-TO-engineer |
| 8. User approval | Delivery accept | TODO ☐ → ☒; issue closed; PR per mode |

## GitHub label scheme

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ginee:ready` | Pickup candidate (`☐` equivalent) |
| `ginee:in-progress` | PM has dispatched; phases 1–7 in flight |
| `ginee:blocked` | Stoppable intermediate state; awaiting user / external |
| `value:high|medium|low` | Triage scoring — reporter-defined business impact (D23) |
| `complexity:high|medium|low` | Triage scoring — reporter or SA auto-estimate (D23) |
| (closed issue) | Done — implicit, no label change needed |

## Triage scoring (D23)

```
score = value / complexity                # H=3, M=2, L=1 (ATAM H/M/L)
```

| value \ complexity | H | M | L |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H** | 1.00 | 1.50 | **3.00** (quick-win) |
| **M** | 0.67 | 1.00 | 2.00 |
| **L** | 0.33 | 0.50 | 1.00 |

`/ginee-triage` sort key: `Score DESC, Age DESC`. Unscored grouped at bottom. TODO marker `☐ [v:H c:L] Description` (case-insensitive). Sticky `<!-- ginee:score v=1 -->` comment per issue; refresh via `@team-lead recompute score #<N>`. Override formula: `local/framework.config.yaml § triage.scoring-formula`.

## Classical-architect SA model (D25)

SA has **three activities** across the lifecycle:

| Activity | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| **Design** | Phase 1 elicit + Phase 2 architecture | Authors `local/requirements.md` (FR/NFR/Constraints) + `local/asr-utility-tree.md` (ASRs via ATAM) + architecture doc + ADRs |
| **Review** | Any phase, on engineer-proposed arch changes | APPROVE / REJECT / REQUEST-CHANGES; never edits code |
| **Governance** | Continuous, scoped to PRs touching SA-owned files | Drift-flag + dispatch back to owning engineer |

**D25 doc-ownership map** (per `core/doc-roles.md`):

| Doc class | Owner |
|---|---|
| Architecture doc · ADRs · requirements register · ASR utility tree · diagrams | `solution-architect` |
| CRs · project-instruction file · work-breakdown | `team-lead` |
| CI/CD guide · infra runbooks | `devops-engineer` |
| Backend READMEs · API docs · service docs | `backend-engineer` |
| Frontend READMEs · component docs · style guides | `frontend-engineer` |
| Test plans · scenario docs · QA reports | `qa-engineer` |
| Mockup | mockup-owning role (default `frontend-engineer`) |

**Engineer-proposed architectural change** (delta to contract / topology / stack / NFR-affecting): draft in final report → SA `§ Review` → APPROVE/REJECT/REQUEST-CHANGES → engineer implements after APPROVE. Local bug fixes (no architectural delta) route engineer → engineer; no SA dispatch.

**Greenfield vs delta** — discovery detects "no architecture doc" → `greenfield: true` in `local/project-profile.md` → SA enters greenfield design on first non-trivial task. Delta mode produces ADR + ASR amendments; never rewrites the architecture doc wholesale.

Migration on upgrade: `@team-lead rediscover` runs Step 8c re-attribution sweep per [`core/MIGRATIONS/D25-classical-architect.md`](https://github.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/ginee/blob/main/core/MIGRATIONS/D25-classical-architect.md).

## Address review on a PR (D24)

```
/ginee-address-review #<PR>               # ingest review comments + reviews
@team-lead address-review #<PR>           # command equivalent (every adapter)
```

Procedure: fetch `pulls/{N}/comments` + `/reviews` → dedup by `thread-id` (skip resolved + already-marked) → route each remark per `local/bindings.md § Source-of-truth ownership` → **surface plan table for approval (forced-interactive, even in `auto:`)** → dispatch specialists in parallel → squash fixes into one cycle commit + push → post per-thread replies + one sticky cycle summary. Lossless coverage (every remark → fix OR reply). Markers `<!-- ginee:review-reply r=<id> -->` (per-thread) + `<!-- ginee:review-cycle n=<N> -->` (sticky).

## Subagent-return schema (D29)

Every cardinal-dispatch return is schema-bound per `core/templates/phase-report.md`.

```
Status: Done | In-progress | Blocked | Hand-off

## Files touched           # table — path · Δ lines · purpose       (required; (none) if empty)
## Decisions made          # bullets — imperative + cite (≤ 80 ch)  (required; (none) if empty)
## Verification log        # table — command · outcome              (required)
## Open issues             # bullets — issue + owner (≤ 80 ch)      (required; (none) if empty)
## Next dispatch needed    # one-liner — role · surface · reason    (required; (none) if empty)
## Hand-off                # core/templates/hand-off-note.md         (forced-handoff only)
## Stop-state              # Done / In-progress / Not-started        (Status: In-progress only)
## Notes                   # free prose · ≤ 200 words                (optional escape hatch)
```

**6 mandatory checks before report-as-done** — 5 from D22 / D26 + *no narrative preamble*. **Forbidden** — narrative preamble · restated dispatch context · code snippets outside the Notes carve-out · verbose rationale outside `## Notes` · parenthetical comma-soup. Target reduction vs free-form returns: ~70%.

## Source-of-truth pattern

```
local/index/*               ← default read every dispatch
docs/* (raw)                ← on demand only (verbatim wording matters)
local/bindings.md           ← governance + tie-breakers
local/project-profile.md    ← discovered project context
local/framework.config.yaml ← concept → path mappings
```

## Strict-domain rule (forbidden role-crossings)

Per `local/bindings.md § Project role boundaries`. Each row is a hard stop.

| Role | Must NOT edit |
|---|---|
| `solution-architect` | mockup, server source, client source, IaC, Dockerfiles, CI workflows. **(D25)** CRs · project-instruction · work-breakdown → `team-lead`; per-tier docs → tier engineers. SA reviews these for architectural coherence; does not edit. |
| `frontend-engineer` | server source (incl. SQL in API endpoints), IaC, Dockerfiles, CI workflows |
| `backend-engineer` | client source, mockup, IaC, Dockerfiles, CI workflows |
| `devops-engineer` | application code, schema migrations, application config content |
| `qa-engineer` | mockup, production server / client code (owns test code only) |
| `ai-engineer` | rules / invariants / requirements (semantics → **the doc's authoring role per D25**, not SA-only); production / test / IaC code |
| `team-lead` | everything except `local/*` written during discovery + **(D25)** CRs · project-instruction · work-breakdown which team-lead authors |

Cross-domain need surfaced mid-task → **propose hand-off in final report**. Never patch across. **Engineer-proposed architectural changes (D25)** route to `solution-architect § Review` (APPROVE / REJECT / REQUEST-CHANGES).

## Index file Load-when tiers

Per cardinal role kernel `## Source of truth`:

- **always** — foundational; loaded every dispatch (single-digit KB combined).
- **scope-loaded** — trigger phrase (e.g. `wire/endpoint touch`, `infra work`, `dep bump`, `test authoring`). Loaded only when the task description matches.

Specialist reports loaded set in first response.

## Iteration protocol (work &gt; 15 min)

1. Estimation-first dispatch — task decomposition + per-task minutes **before** edits.
2. User approves the batch.
3. 3–5 min iterations, each stoppable.
4. Stop anywhere → resume next session with zero rework.

## Delivery modes (D17)

| Prefix | Mode | Phase 8 |
|---|---|---|
| `branch:` | feature branch + PR | `gh pr create` with `Closes #<N>` |
| `wt:` | working-tree only | PM surfaces `git diff`; user commits / discards |
| `commit:` | commit-no-push | PM surfaces `git log`; user pushes |

Framework defaults: `branch` for issue / TODO-sourced; `wt` for freeform. Auto-mode default: `wt`.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Specialist refuses to edit a file | Forbidden role-crossing | Dispatch the owning role |
| Index is dormant ("no consumer") | Novel class extracted but no kernel cites it | Wire via `local/bindings.md § Project-specific index citations` or remove the class |
| `local/index/` &gt; 30% of `docs/` size | Recipe over-extracting | Run `/ginee-reindex` against the worst class; check compression target ≤ 0.5 |
| Discovery flagged staleness on a doc | SHA-256 drift | `/ginee-reindex <source>` (scoped) or `/ginee-reindex` (whole-repo — also catches net-new files) or `/ginee-rediscover` |
| New doc / config landed but isn't in `local/index/` | Net-new file within existing class | `/ginee-reindex` reconciles; `/ginee-rediscover` only needed for novel classes (new directory / new tool) |
| PR didn't auto-close issue on merge | Stacked PR merged into non-default branch first | Manual `gh issue close <N> --comment "..."` |
| Trivial task loads full 64 KB baseline | Role kernel `Load when` not honoured | Specialist should report loaded set; if it doesn't, your kernel may be stale — `/ginee-update` to refresh |
| Framework feels out of date / missing a recent feature | Local install behind upstream | `/ginee-update` (latest release) or `/ginee-update <tag>` (named ref); never auto-updates — adopter approves the plan |
| Triage shows everything "Unscored" | No `value:*` / `complexity:*` labels yet | Reporter sets `value` at file-time; SA auto-estimates `complexity` on pickup; or `@team-lead recompute score #<N>` after `gh issue edit` |
| Review comments piling up on a PR | No invocation yet | `/ginee-address-review #<PR>` — plan-table approval is forced-interactive even in `auto:` |
| Adopter doc PR fails markdown lint | D22 doc-authoring protocol — discovered linter ran | Apply default-shape map (tables / bullets / definitions) per `core/doc-authoring-protocol.md`; verify with `${commands.lint.docs}` |
| ginee-filed issue / framework-authored comment has dense parenthetical-soup prose | D26 scope extension — self-lint missed it | Restructure per default-shape map (tables for inventories · bullets for multi-rule · no parenthetical comma-lists in sentences); covers every section, including Summary |
