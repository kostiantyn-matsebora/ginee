# Changelog

All notable changes to ginee. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the framework adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Public OSS release prep** — `LICENSE` (MIT), `SECURITY.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`.
- **Documentation site** under `docs/` — Jekyll cayman theme with indigo + amber palette, custom layout, theme toggle, page TOC.
- **Index protocol — per-file load triggers** (issue #11). Cardinal role `## Source of truth` tables gain a `Load when` column. Two-tier model: `always` for foundational reads + scope-loaded with trigger phrase. Specialist reports loaded set in first response. Adopter overrides via new `local/bindings.md § Per-role load-trigger overrides`.
- **Index protocol — consumer coupling** (issue #10). Every extracted class declares `consumed-by: [<role>...]` in `manifest.yaml`. Novel classes without a declared consumer are not extracted; discovery report flags any dormant index. New `local/bindings.md § Project-specific index citations` section wires novel classes to cardinal roles without editing upstream kernels.
- **Installer auto-migration** — `install.ps1` / `install.sh` detect pre-rebrand `.agents/engineering-team/` and rename to `.agents/ginee/` on first run, preserving `local/` contents.

### Changed

- **Rebrand: `engineering-team` → `ginee`** across all framework artefacts. D11 revised — `ginee` is now the formal public name (formerly the codename). Skill prefix `ginee-` is now consistent at every surface. Install path `.agents/engineering-team/` → `.agents/ginee/`. Env vars `ET_*` → `GINEE_*`. Tagline: *An AI software engineering team that behaves like a real one. Drops into your project, self-onboards, and gets to work.*
- **Index protocol — compression floor** (issue #9). New `§ Compression floor` sub-rule: `index-bytes / source-bytes ≥ 0.5 = recipe failed`. Remedies: rewrite recipe to drop bulk, or mark class `read-source-directly`. Per-class targets: ≤ 0.15 prose, ≤ 0.25 list-of-records, ≤ 0.15 structured-config inventory. Lossless rule clarified — coverage is about *existence-entries* (name + source-anchor), not *fidelity*. Full metadata stays in source.
- **D15 code-category recipes rewritten** (issue #9). `builtin:package-manifest` and `builtin:container-orchestration` now record inventory only (existence + anchors). Per-service ports / depends_on / replicas / resources / env-vars stay in compose / Helm / k8s source; per-dep listing stays in the manifest source.
- **Manifest schema extended** — entries gain `source-bytes`, `index-bytes`, `compression`, `consumed-by` fields.
- **`core/templates/bindings.md § Source of truth (read before any work)` renamed to `§ Source-of-truth ownership`** (issue #7). Section reframed as a governance / who-edits-what map. Raw doc paths no longer surface as a competing "read first" tier — `local/index/*` is the only default read surface.

### Fixed

- **Installer `-UpdateOnly` mode** now correctly re-fetches `core/`, `adapters/`, `extras/` after wiping them.
- **Installer skill copy on update** — existing `ginee-*` skill directories are cleared before re-copying (previously failed with "directory already exists").

## 0.1.0 — initial dogfood baseline

### Added

- **7 cardinal roles** (`project-manager`, `solution-architect`, `ai-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, `backend-engineer`, `devops-engineer`, `qa-engineer`) with generic aliases.
- **Phase 1–8 lifecycle** in `core/process.md` — analysis / design / review / implementation / testing / bug fixing / SA review / user approval.
- **4 adapters** — `claude` (tier-1), `copilot-cli` (tier-1), `agents-md` (tier-2), `generic` (tier-3).
- **5 opt-in specialists** under `extras/roles/` — security · ml · mobile · sre · data.
- **`local/` layer** — `project-profile.md`, `bindings.md`, `framework.config.yaml`, `roles/`, `index/`. Survives framework updates.
- **Discovery flow** — `project-manager` writes `local/*` on first run; detects stack / architecture-doc / mockup / ADR / CR / scenario layout.
- **Index protocol (D13)** — extracted summaries under `local/index/`; SHA-256 staleness; doc-category recipes.
- **Code-derived index extension (D15)** — code/config sources added via `stack.yaml` / `topology.yaml` / `commands.yaml` / `conventions.yaml` / `runtime-facts.yaml` / `repo-map.idx`.
- **GitHub issues integration (D14)** — file / pick up / triage / promote workflows. Native `open`/`closed` + `ginee:*` labels. PR auto-close via `Fixes #N`.
- **AgentSkills (D16)** — 10 skills under `core/skills/ginee-*/SKILL.md`. Cross-client via per-adapter bridge.
- **Delivery modes (D17)** — Mode 1 (branch + PR) / Mode 2 (working-tree only) / Mode 3 (commit-no-push). Resolved by per-task prefix → Phase-3 answer → adopter default → framework default.
- **Automatic mode (D12)** — `auto:` per-task prefix elides intermediate gates; Phase 8 becomes a single Accept / Feedback / Reject delivery handoff.
- **17 locked decisions** documented in `PLAN.md`.
- **Iteration protocol** — estimation-first dispatch + 3–5 min stoppable batches for work &gt; 15 min.
- **Strict-domain rule** — forbidden role-crossings per `local/bindings.md § Project role boundaries`.
- **Cross-domain bugs** procedure in `core/cross-domain-bugs.md` — propose → implement → verify cycle.
- **Cross-agent hand-off** procedure in `core/cross-agent-handoff.md` — diagnose ≠ fix.

### Notes

This release represents the dogfood baseline used during the framework's own development. The first public-OSS-ready release will be tagged after the rebrand to `ginee` lands.
